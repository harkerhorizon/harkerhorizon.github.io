*This paper studies how urchins process the kelp they eat through observing how dependent detritivores are on urchins for kelp detritus assimilation. The detritivores consumed significant amounts of kelp, signifying that urchins can actually play a positive role in the ecosystem by making kelp available to detritivores (in addition to just the "traditional view" that they are destroying kelp forests.)*
