*This article describes how MIT researchers have developed computational models that can simulate the spread of viruses. The models are unique because they were based in the field of Natural Language Processingâ€”they were originally built to analyze language. They can also predict which individual sections of viral proteins mutate, making them important contributors to both vaccine research and containment efforts.*
