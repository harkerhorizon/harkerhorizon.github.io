Dear Reader:

We are proud to present to you the second print edition of Horizon.

With this publication came costs we initially weren’t sure we could meet. One of our goals this year was to raise enough funds to cover printing costs and purchase InDesign licenses. Wary of the environmental impact that hundreds of plastic boba cups and straws would have, we decided to go for something completely new, with the support of Mr. Spenner and our staff: a fundraiser with Krispy Kreme donuts and Quickly’s popcorn chicken. With 300 donuts and 150 servings of popcorn chicken in total, what we initially thought would surely be an overly ambitious fundraising goal turned out to be a massive success.

Like our fundraiser, this year’s issue reflects the risks we’ve taken to redesign and reimagine Horizon. Since the publication of our first issue last year, we have invested countless hours to iteratively refine our journal while building on the foundations laid by those who came before us to preserve Horizon’s core vision in its content and its aesthetic.

Within these pages, you’ll discover that each piece is infused with the curiosity and creativity of our talented contributors. We hope that Horizon encourages you to be engaged with the scientific endeavors happening around us and in the world and to perhaps even channel this interest into your own pursuits.

As with our first issue, in this year’s publication, you will be able to dive into a vast array of topics, from inquiring into the safety of AI in the future with Ashwin Reddy (‘19), to exploring how wilderness could function as a natural laboratory with Andy Semenza (‘18), to learning about how Rajiv Movva (‘18) characterized genetic mutations in non-coding DNA using machine learning techniques.

In addition to the print publication you are now reading, we are excited to also announce the release of our redesigned website, horizon.harker.org. Our website carries the content that we could not fit into the print edition, as well as an archive of previous student submissions.

We could not have accomplished what we did this year without the support of many. We are grateful to Mr. Spenner, our faculty advisor, who provided us with invaluable support and wisdom throughout this journey. We’d like to also thank each one of our staff members for their unwavering dedication throughout the year. Lastly, we thank all those who submitted their amazing work to be published in Horizon.

Enjoy!
