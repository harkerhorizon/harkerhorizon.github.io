*New technology explores the prediction of the freezing of gait to improve lives.*

<!--excerpt-->

In January 2018, Helen Bronte-Stewart’s neurology lab at Stanford published a paper in Movement Disorders detailing an experiment that monitored the effectiveness of coordinated reset vibrotactile stimulation, electrical impulses meant to “reset” neuron bodies, for Parkinson’s patients as shown in the image below. More specifically, the researchers sought to alleviate a Parkinsonian symptom known as freezing of gait where a patient suddenly feels as if “their feet are ‘stuck to the floor as if held by magnets,’” leaving them thus unable to move (Weiss, 2020).

Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder thought to be caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in a region of the brain in the upper brainstem known as the substantia nigra (Parkinson’s Disease Information Page). Since dopamine is a neurotransmitter vital to movement regulation, some of the most common Parkinsonian symptoms include tremors (shaking that occurs generally at rest), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), muscular rigidity (stiffness and inflexibility), and postural instability (impaired balance) as shown in the image below. 

While there is currently no cure for this disease, drugs like levodopa, which is turned into dopamine by the body, can make an impactful difference in the patient’s quality of life by helping them control their symptoms. However, levodopa does not resolve all of the patient’s symptoms like freezing of gait (FOG) a symptom which 53% of patients with moderate to advanced Parkinson’s experience. Scientists have shown that FOG is an expression of the high asymmetry and arrhythmicity in the patient’s gait cycle. Asymmetry refers to the patient being unable to swing their arms with one another as one arm swings more than the other while arrhythmicity refers to the patient being unable to maintain a consistent stride time. As freezers have higher gait asymmetry and arrhythmicity than non-freezers, correcting the asymmetry and arrhythmicity could potentially stop future freezing episodes. This is where the Bronte-Stewart lab comes in.
