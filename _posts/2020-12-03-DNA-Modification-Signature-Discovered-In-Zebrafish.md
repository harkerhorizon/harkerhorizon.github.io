*This study summarizes recent research done on zebrafish DNA investigating to investigate a process called DNA methylation, or the process of modifying DNA using methyl groups to adjust gene function. Since the zebrafish shares a large portion of DNA with humans and are ancient ancestors, the new form of DNA methylation discovered in the zebrafish proves potentially important in furthering understanding neurodevelopmental disorders in humans.*
