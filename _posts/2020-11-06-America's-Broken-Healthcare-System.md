*Analyzing the factors behind America’s expensive yet ineffective healthcare system.*

<!--excerpt-->

The US spends more money on healthcare than any other country in the world at $3.5 trillion, or 18% of the US GDP. What makes the situation utterly irredeemable is that this spending does not translate into the US having the best outcomes or highest life expectancy worldwide. In fact, in the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study, the US healthcare system was ranked only 29th in the world, and, in 2017, the CIA ranked US life expectancy as only 43rd in the world. The problem lies in the US healthcare system. Healthcare reimbursement is set up so that sick care is valued over health care: the US mops the floor instead of shutting off the faucet. Moreover, doctors’ concerns about upsetting patients and potential resulting legal repercussions lead to expensive, unnecessary care with overtesting, overdiagnosing, and overtreating. America’s healthcare system is broken. 
Imagine that every person in the US crosses a bridge that hangs over a fast-paced stream daily. The walls of this bridge are relatively low, so people occasionally fall into the stream. Once in the stream, a professional fishes them out, or at least tries to. Often, the same person falls off the bridge, again and again, and needs to be rescued from the stream, again and again. In a nutshell, this is the current US healthcare system where intervention takes precedence over prevention. Instead of building higher walls on the bridge or installing a safety net, the US healthcare system focuses primarily on downstream interventions. We treat symptoms rather than addressing the root causes. Indeed, the Pareto Principle explains how 20% of patients account for 80% of healthcare costs because these patients keep coming back to the ER with the very same chronic diseases that are treated but never healed.

Primary care physicians (PCPs) are perhaps the most significant specialty in the entirety of medicine as, after all, they are the base of the pyramid of healthcare. Indeed, they are the vanguard of preventive medicine, but our current healthcare system does not permit them to properly do their job. The US government and insurance companies alike do not sufficiently emphasize preventive medicine as they reimburse these PCPs based on the number of patients they see, not the outcomes they produce. Therefore, to merely stay afloat, PCPs must rush through patient visits, unable to properly take a history or give patients the quality time and care they deserve. Many PCPs thus feel as if they cannot help their patients in a truly meaningful way, contributing to widespread disillusionment and burnout. 
From a patient’s perspective, the experience is perhaps even more harrowing. After waiting for sometimes hours on end, partly in the waiting room and then partly in the examination room, the frenetic physician finishes the visit in perhaps fifteen minutes, leaving little time to answer the patient’s questions. Often times, these patients are just referred off to a specialist because the PCP genuinely does not have the time to dig deeper, to diagnose and address the underlying issues as they are trained to do. This problem is only accentuated with the acute PCP shortage the US is experiencing as more and more new doctors become higher-paying specialists. 
Many patients in the US have also never seen a PCP. The failure or inability to interact with this first line of defense against disease often results in these patients arriving in the emergency department with severely exacerbated conditions that could have been caught and treated in the condition’s earlier stages. Furthermore, the goal in the emergency department is almost always reduced to merely intervening to relieve acute symptoms. Heart attack? Put a stent in the coronary artery to relieve the chest pain and then send the patient home. In the emergency department, time is rarely put towards prevention, towards empowering the patient to live a healthier lifestyle to, for example, prevent heart attacks in the first place. Therefore, that same patient may very well come back to the emergency department a few months later with yet another heart attack because the underlying issue was never dealt with it. The US healthcare system is much more comfortable with employing drugs and surgeries instead of the low-cost but extremely effective lifestyle changes.
