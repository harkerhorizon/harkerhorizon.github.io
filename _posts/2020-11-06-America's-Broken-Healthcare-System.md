*Analyzing the factors behind America’s expensive yet ineffective healthcare system.*

<!--excerpt-->

The US spends more money on healthcare than any other country in the world at $3.5 trillion, or 18% of the US GDP. What makes the situation utterly irredeemable is that this spending does not translate into the US having the best outcomes or highest life expectancy worldwide. In fact, in the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study, the US healthcare system was ranked only 29th in the world, and, in 2017, the CIA ranked US life expectancy as only 43rd in the world. The problem lies in the US healthcare system. Healthcare reimbursement is set up so that sick care is valued over health care: the US mops the floor instead of shutting off the faucet. Moreover, doctors’ concerns about upsetting patients and potential resulting legal repercussions lead to expensive, unnecessary care with overtesting, overdiagnosing, and overtreating. America’s healthcare system is broken. 
Imagine that every person in the US crosses a bridge that hangs over a fast-paced stream daily. The walls of this bridge are relatively low, so people occasionally fall into the stream. Once in the stream, a professional fishes them out, or at least tries to. Often, the same person falls off the bridge, again and again, and needs to be rescued from the stream, again and again. In a nutshell, this is the current US healthcare system where intervention takes precedence over prevention. Instead of building higher walls on the bridge or installing a safety net, the US healthcare system focuses primarily on downstream interventions. We treat symptoms rather than addressing the root causes. Indeed, the Pareto Principle explains how 20% of patients account for 80% of healthcare costs because these patients keep coming back to the ER with the very same chronic diseases that are treated but never healed.
