Abstract:

Bacteriophage φKZ is resistant to the DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 system. Hydroxylamine mutagenesis of φKZ did not result in the weakening of the nucleus-like shell that surrounds the DNA of the bacteriophage φKZ and thus, enabled the bacteriophage φKZ to physically obstruct the Cas9 enzyme. Mutants with this desired phenotype may exist in the pool of mutant phages but were not isolated in the panel that was screened. 

The DNA sequence that contains the protospacer region of the gene gp146 of the bacteriophage φKZ is targeted by Cas13a enzyme. Without the protospacer region in the DNA to be transcribed to RNA, bacteriophage φKZ is no longer sensitive to RNA-targeting Cas13a enzyme.

Objectives/Goals 
There is a continuous warfare between bacteria and bacteriophages (viruses) that infect them. Bacteria have developed CRISPR-Cas immune systems to protect themselves from invading bacteriophages. The CRISPR system uses acquired immunity, taking the DNA of bacteriophages that have previously infected it and remembering them for future infections. Upon infection, the stored DNA sequence is then cut and removed from the rest of the gene sequence, making the CRISPR system a power tool for gene-editing. Genes surrounding the CRISPR system are known as Cas, CRISPR Associated Systems, and the Type II CRISPR is found exclusively in bacteria. However, bacteriophages are unique in their interactions with the CRISPR system. Some bacteriophages such as φKZ are highly unpredictable in their actions, and their features are just being discovered. In the war between bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and jumbo bacteriophage φKZ, it appears that φKZ is winning. φKZ has developed its own form of protection from the CRISPR-Cas system, resisting many DNA-targeting bacterial immune systems including CRISPR-Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, and restriction-modification systems. It has been shown that φKZ forms a nucleus-like shell around its DNA, and nucleases such as Cas9 are physically obstructed by the shell (S. D. Mendoza). However, φKZ is sensitive to an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzyme, Cas13a. The main goal of this project was to understand the mechanism by which bacteriophage φKZ interacts with different CRISPR-Cas systems. The specific aim was to identify φKZ mutants which are sensitive to DNA-targeting by Cas9 and mutants that are resistant to RNA-targeting by Cas13a. A chemical mutagenesis approach was used to create mutations in the DNA sequence of φKZ. The mutant φKZ bacteriophages (phages) were then screened to determine if any of the mutants could be defeated by Cas9 and for escapers of the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzyme, Cas13a. The mutant phages that escaped the Cas13a enzyme were sequenced to understand how they avoid Cas13a recognition. 
Methods/Materials 
Bacteriophage φKZ was mutated with hydroxylamine, which is known to cause a non-reversible single nucleotide mutation of cytosine to thymine. The mutagenesis was conducted as described in R. Villafane (2009)’s paper. Mutated φKZ was plated on a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain plate (PA101). The φKZ were then isolated with a toothpick and re-plated onto bacterial strain SDM065 (Cas9, II-A cRNA-φKZ) and the corresponding control strain SDM056 (Cas9, II-A cR9NA-JBD30). The bacterial strain named SDM065 or SDM056 are both Cas9 systems that target the type II-A CRISPR-RNA (cRNA) of the phages φKZ or JBD30, respectively. These two strains tested the sensitivity of mutated phages against Cas9 enzyme. SDM056 serves as the control, as it targets the cRNA of JBD30, a phage not used in this project. The phage will form a plaque no matter the mutation’s success. As SDM065 targets the cRNA of φKZ, a phage typically resistant to the CRISPR system, it would be revealed if the mutation had created a weakness in φKZ as φKZ would plaque if the mutation was successful.
Additionally, φKZ mutants were tested for temperature sensitivity as well by incubating the plates at the elevated temperature of 42°C compared to 30°C for the control group. Some phage DNA becomes sensitive to mutations at high temperatures. The high temperature activates the mutation, creating more opportunities for mutations that show sensitivity to the CRISPR system.
For identifying escapers of cas13a RNA-targeting, mutant phages were directly plated onto bacterial strain SDM078 that tested sensitivity towards RNA-targeting Cas13a enzyme system. Those that grew despite φKZ’s typical vulnerability to the CRISPR system were identified as escapers. While mutant phages were tested for their escaper tendencies, the natural or wild-type bacteriophages were tested as well. The phages that escaped targeting were purified and their CRISPR-targeting protospacer region was amplified using PCR and subsequently sequenced. 
Results
A thousand-fold decrease in titer value of bacteriophage φKZ was observed after mutagenesis with 0.4 M hydroxylamine for forty-eight hours. This solution of mutated φKZ was used for all subsequent experiments. One-thousand five-hundred-forty mutants from hydroxylamine mutagenesis were screened for both Cas9 and temperature sensitivity. The Cas9 sensitivity was tested by plating each mutant onto bacterial strain SDM065, designed to target the head gene gp146 of φKZ. None of mutants were found to be sensitive to the Cas9 enzyme.
