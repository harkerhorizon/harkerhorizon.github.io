*Researchers are attempting to increase the spectrum of light from which they can extract energy in solar cells and solar panels by layering multiple different materials, each with a unique absorption spectrum, on top of each other. By layering different materials, the energy from each portion of the spectrum, from UV to infrared, can be converted with a lower rate of energy loss, increasing the entire cell’s efficiency.*
